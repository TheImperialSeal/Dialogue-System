// This script acts as a single point for all other scripts to get
// the current input from. It uses Unity's new Input System and
// functions should be mapped to their corresponding controls
// using a PlayerInput component with Unity Events.


//Pretty much none of this does anything so don't worry about it
//If I delete it then it messes up other stuff but it pretty much does nothing. I could get rid of it but
//I do intend to use it later on and I already set the UI system up to think it's using this even though it isn't.
//I still don't really understand the fancy input system here and I have other stuff I'm working on at the moment
//I'll come back to this

//also I wrote none of this, I shamelessly stole it
